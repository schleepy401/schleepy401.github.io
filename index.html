            I am not a web dev by any means, so when I wanted to update my old portfolio (which I made using a very heavy theme) 
            and saw it loading too slowly due to ultra complicated CSS and JS, I thought well, let's just don't use all that fancy stuff at all
            (also I hate CSS, even tho I had to use a little here for some functions). 
            <blockquote>
               <i>"And that's how we ended up with this."</i>
            </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, this website is ultra responsive (hell yeah, no fancy <span style="font-family: monospace"> @media-query </span> stuff) and compatible with literally <b>ALL BROWSERS.</b> Due to no heavy styling, it loads up ultra-fast
            and gets my thing done.
        </p>

        <h2>
            By the way, here's some stuff about me.

            I am a 2021 CS Grad, and I'm still trying to find my way in technology. As such, I do not have any specific interests or skills in
            any special technology or anything like that. I try my hand at whatever I feel like doing, and fail at it.

        <p>
            I am currently doing an underpaid ultra entry level job at a tier-3 service based company <!--InfoFUCKINGsys--> (hint: the founder's son-in-law is 
            contesting for the UK Prime Minister elections as of July 2022, when I was making this website). Other than that, I have worked
            as an intern and contributed good-for-nothing lines of code using my non-existent tech skills for the following organisations:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Agnos Inc. (Jul 2021 - Jan 2022):</b> Worked across various teams such as ETL and Recruitment, as well as in support 
                    and maintenance for the required tools, whilst also working on some internal requirements, and maintaining the company 
                    website, doing the required bugfixes and developing new modules for the site.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>applex.in (Jul 2020 - August 2020):</b> Worked on designing and implementing the User Interface, and enabling as well as integrating 
                    Firebase features in a project.
                </li>
            </ul>
            I also once ran a tech community with my friends, where I was a full-time contributor to the Android channel and even conducted live 
            teaching sessions for their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxBTPRcBE4AWmRP67A5MFXJQmAVaGa--D">YouTube channel.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can find my projects and other tech stuff about me down there in the links section. I love FOSS stuff, but being your
            below average IT worker, I can't remove windows as I sometimes need my personal machine for some stuff and the tools I use
            don't work on Linux. However, I have used Linux and I love that thing. So sad I can't write <i>I use Arch btw</i> over here,
            because I actually don't.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Non-tech stuff
        </h3>
        <p>
            Other than technology, I love music, pretty much of all kinds (other than KPop). I also break strings and fingers on the guitar and
            damage others' ears by wailing in my hoarse voice and calling it singing. I also pretend to look cool and intellectual by buying books,
            reading a few pages and then never touching them again. No specific genre of books tho.
